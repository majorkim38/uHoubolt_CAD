# µHoubolt CAD
Space Team's µHoubolt CAD Files, SolidWorks & Step

Now with actually useful STEP files! And FreeCAD .FCStd as an extra.
Still work in progress!

Extracting parts and assemblies with VariCAD. VariCAD opens the uHoubolt.step without any issue, by a miracle of Dark Sun Gwyndolin or other deity.

How did I obtained VariCAD? I prefer not to say, but it was the only choice.

Lesson learned: use OS software to design OS hardware.
