Space Team's µHoubolt CAD Files, SolidWorks & Step
Now with actually useful STEP files!
Still work in progress!
Converting SolidWorks files to STEP using CAD Exchanger.
How did I obtained CAD Exchanger? I prefer not to say, but it was the only choice.
Some SolidWorks files don't import to CAD Exchanger, including complete assembly (uHoubolt.SLDASM). Some files require standard parts included into SolidWorks by default, like DIN fasteners.
Fully completed: Engine assembly
